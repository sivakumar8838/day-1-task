HTTP/1.1

1.The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997

2.HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one 
resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

3.HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for 
almost all web applications

4.Because it went through several stages of development, this first version
of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1

5.This version is still in use on the web


HTTP/2

1.In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created

2.HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate

3.HTTP/2 does this by splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these 
messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.

4.To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages 
to make them smaller

5.Cloudflare supports all features of HTTP/2. Web properties on Cloudflare can turn 
on HTTP/2 for free with one click. Cloudflare supports HTTP/3 in addition to HTTP/2.
